            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p><em>The State of JavaScript Survey</em> started with this amazing and astounding animation in 2018. Simple, tasteful design with the deep challenge in it. A challenge whether I can make anything which
            resembles even a bit the intro motion of the original one.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Resources
        </h3>
        <p>
            The original <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/">site</a> was the alpha and omega of this project.
            The design and the whole theme was ready, I just created a challenge for myself to produce something similar
            with my basic tools. And yes it is funny that the root page is analyzing ES6, Typescript etc., but I used
            only the most basic things.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Team
        </h3>
        <p>
            This challenge was a one-man show (coding), though once again I must emphasise that the original theme and design comes from the mentioned Survey. 
        </p>

            P.S. Please note that <em>The State of JavaScript Survey</em> has an update for <a
                href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/">2019</a>.
