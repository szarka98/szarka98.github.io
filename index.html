            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>JavaScript is always changing. New libraries, new frameworks, new languages… It's part of the fun, but it
            can
            also feel overwhelming sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's where the State of JavaScript survey comes in: this year, we surveyed over 20,000 JavaScript
            developers
            to figure out what they're using, what they're happy with, and what they want to learn. And the result is a
            unique collection of stats and insights that will hopefully help you make your own way through the
            JavaScript
            ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to learn more about what's new this year, check out our <a href="">announcement post</a> for
            more details.

        <h3>
            Resources
        </h3>
        <p>
            We figure a lot of you are checking out this survey to help you figure out what to learn next. So we've
            included
            links to useful JavaScript resources throughout the survey to help point you in the right direction.
        </p>

        <p>
            Full disclosure: some of them are paid sponsorships, but no matter what they're all high-quality resources
            from
            people we know and respect who have decided to support our project.
        </p>
